## Tool to manage the COVID-19 testing waiting lists
---
- **Tool to manage PCR COVID-19 testing waiting lists by sorting the candidates through a priority score**
- **The number of tests that can be carried out daily is limited and the number of people waiting to be tested grows with every wave, therefore a way to manage the waiting lists is needed**
- **The tool could make the process of testing smoother and even save lives and limit the spread of the virus through detecting the worst cases with anticipation** 
- **Improvements to the database and score system should be made in the future**
